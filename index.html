<h1> Gorgon's Head Summary</h1>
    <br>"The Gorgon's Head" is a story from Tanglewood Tales, a collection of Greek myths retold by Nathaniel Hawthorne.
    <br>The tale recounts the heroic adventure of Perseus, a young demigod tasked with slaying Medusa, one of the three Gorgon sisters.
    <br>Medusa was a terrifying creature with snakes for hair, and anyone who looked directly at her would be turned to stone.
    <br>Guided by the gods Athena and Hermes, Perseus receives magical items: a reflective shield, a sword, a pair of winged sandals, a helmet of invisibility, and a magical pouch.
    <br>Using the reflective shield to avoid Medusa's gaze, Perseus successfully beheads her. 
    <br>He places her head in the magical pouch and later uses it as a powerful weapon, as the head retains the ability to turn people to stone.
    <br><br>The story highlights themes of bravery, cleverness, and divine guidance, illustrating Perseus's journey as a hero favored by the gods.</p>
